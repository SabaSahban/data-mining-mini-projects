# Data Mining – Practical Assignments

This repository contains practical assignments from a **Data Mining** course, implemented in **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**. Each notebook focuses on a core data mining task, including preprocessing, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and pattern mining.

## Contents

### HW1 – Exploratory Analysis & Distance Computation
- Dataset: `worldcities.xlsx`
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Geographic distance computation (Haversine distance from Tehran)
- Basic statistics and visualizations

### HW2 – Regression & Classification
- Dataset: `worldcities.xlsx`
- Regression to predict city population
- Classification using discretized population levels
- Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
- Evaluation using MSE and accuracy

### HW3 – Supervised Classification (Adult Income)
- Datasets: `Adult_TrainDataset.csv`, `Adult_TestDataset.csv`
- Binary income classification
- Models: SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost
- Evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report

### HW4 – Clustering & Association Rule Mining
- Datasets: `Country-data.csv`, `GroceryStoreDataSet.csv`
- PCA + DBSCAN for country clustering
- Apriori algorithm for frequent itemsets and association rules
